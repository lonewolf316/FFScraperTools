# FFScraperTools
A collection of tchotchkes and gizmos for dealing with the databases put out by the Fanfictioin Scraper V2.

This is mostly stuff made for myself but may be useful for others trying to scrape fanfiction for whatever reason.

These may be useful for dealing specifically with Fanfiction scrape databases, assuming all DBs are following the formatting used in this tool, and my scraper.
